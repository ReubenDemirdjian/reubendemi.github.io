title: "Welcome! I hope you learn something."

Hello! I'm Reuben and I research two main areas:
1. Quantum computing methods for differential equations and fluid dynamics,
2. Numerical weather prediction and atmospheric dynamics.

I made this webpage to share some of my thoughts in a more informal setting compared to peer-reviewed papers. I hope to breakdown papers into more digestible pieces so that both you, the reader, and I, the author, can learn something. I may also share the occassional random thought or maybe even just some good news. Enjoy!
